          <p class="lead">Introduction</p>

          <p>I received my BA in International Studies and minors in French and Rhetoric from Trinity College in 2023. I have experience in non-profits and community organizations, but underlying my work was my passion for storytelling. I am interested in the intersection of visual communication and critical cultural awareness in different writing spaces. My long-term career goal is to work in the UX/UI or Technical Writing fields.</p>

	  <p>It is necessary to note that the concentration of SWD in East Hartford and New Britain may allude to a bigger problem about funding with charter schools since these schools have the least percentage of SWD enrolled. This may be because charter schools are discouraging SWD to enroll or they simply do not have enough funding to host these students.</p>

          <p>Using data from <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Per-Pupil-Expenditures-by-Function---District/Per-Pupil-Expenditures-by-Object---District?language=en_US">EdSight</a>, the raw data was pulled from two different tables. One raw data set shows the PPE by district and the other shows the number of students with disabilities enrolled by district. The enrollment of students with disabilities by district was converted into a percentage. This data was processed this way in order to show a comparison between the PPE and percentage of students with disabilities enrolled by district.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	  <h4>Procedure Writing</h4>
          <p>These charts were created using data from <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/students/primary-disability?language=en_US">EdSight</a>. In order to create this data story, the raw data had to be filtered and processed by the 33 towns and 38 districts that were relevant to the class’s community partner, Center for Leadership and Justice. When figuring out the percentage of students with disabilities enrolled in New Britain and East Hartford, the raw number of students with disabilities was divided by the total number of students and sorted by school type. The same thing was done to get the percentage enrolled of students of disabilities by district in Figures 1 and 3.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	  <h4>nstructional YouTube Video</h4>
          <p>However, in those Figures, I extracted the PPE data from the raw data and sorted by the relevant districts using VLOOKUP in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JnwnQKQ3PI1UVNcHrOdLRUwR72A8Qv5ul6EvjqXZD1E/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a>. After using VLOOKUP to narrow down the data to the relevant districts, the processed data was organized using Datawrapper to create a scatter chart to show the comparisons between the PPE and enrollment of students with disabilities.</p>

          <h4>Cautions and Limitations</h4>
          <p>Some things to consider is that if the number of students enrolled is five or less, then the data will be suppressed and not show up for calculations– which is why there is no data for school types such as other magnet and open choice in Figure 2. As a result, Open Choice and Other Magnet schools were not included because there was no data (0% enrollment). When processing the raw data, Program School data was not included in Figure 2 because these schools have a high enrollment of SWD to begin with because they are designed for students with disabilities.</p>

	  <p>CT Technical Education and Career Schools was also shortened to CT Technical Schools. Public Schools was changed to “Neighborhood Public Schools” because Public Schools does not adequately describe the kind of school it is because all of the school types from the data are publicly funded.</p>
        
          <p>In Figure 3, Goodwin University Educational Services (GUES) is not included because this data was not available in the data set found on EdSight. This may be because GUES has changed its name over the years and this updated name was not updated for the 2020-21 data sets.</p>
        
          
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>In conclusion, based on all three charts and previous background information, students with disabilities are in school districts that do not have adequate funding based on the ECS formula since the percentage of enrolled SWD should have a stronger correlation with the PPE by district. This data shows that among the two school districts, East Hartford and New Britain, with the highest enrollment of students with disabilities, many of these students are concentrated in neighborhood public schools. This could be due to the fact that it is easier to enroll in neighborhood public schools because they do not have an application process like the other school types mentioned in Figure 1, which explains why they have a higher percentage of enrollment.</p>
          
          <p>For school districts like East Hartford and New Britain that have a higher enrollment of students with disabilities in their neighborhood public schools, it matters how and where funding is distributed. Given that SWD are concentrated in neighborhood public schools, the fact that there is only a moderate positive correlation with per pupil expenditure and enrollment of students with disabilities across districts is a problem. A moderate positive correlation of 0.43 may show equal funding, but equitable funding is needed in order to address systemic barriers that show up in the education system because it does not cater towards students with disabilities or other learning needs.</p>
          
          <p> This is important to note because in order to work towards a more equitable future where all students receive the funding that they need, current funding disparities need to be taken into account and talked about with school boards and other community organizations and members.</p>
